#  Location-Based Video Calling App

This is an Android application that enables users to initiate video calls or connect with other users based on their geographical location.
The app uses a map interface (via Google maps API) to search users. The server randomly connects the nearby person from the searched location if the user is active
It allows video calling them directly.
